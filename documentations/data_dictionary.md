## ðŸ“Š Calculated Fields Used in Analysis

### Dashboard Metrics:

| Calculated Field | Formula/Logic | Purpose |
|------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Average Price by Zip Code** | AVG([Price]) grouped by [Zipcode] | Identify premium locations |
| **Revenue by Week** | SUM([Price]) grouped by WEEK([Date]) | Seasonal trend analysis |
| **Bedroom Category** | Converted [Bedrooms] to Dimension | Property size segmentation |
| **Competition Index** | COUNT(DISTINCT([Id])) by [Bedrooms] | Market saturation analysis |
| **Geographic Coordinates** | [Latitude], [Longitude] for mapping | Spatial visualization |

### Data Quality Filters:
- **Non-null Zip Codes**: Excludes records without location data
- **Valid Price Range**: Removes $0 prices and extreme outliers
- **Complete Listings**: Requires bedroom and bathroom information
- **2016 Data Only**: Filters to single year for consistency

## ðŸš¨ Data Quality Notes

### Known Issues:
1. **Missing Zip Codes**: ~5% of listings lack zip code information
2. **Zero Bedrooms**: Some studio apartments coded as 0 bedrooms
3. **Price Variations**: Calendar prices may differ from listing base price
4. **Incomplete Reviews**: Not all stays result in reviews

### Data Cleaning Applied:
- Removed records with null zip codes for geographic analysis
- Converted bedroom count from measure to dimension
- Filtered out zero-bedroom properties for bedroom analysis
- Standardized price formatting across datasets
